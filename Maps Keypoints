"do maps add anything, to our knowledge of literature?" (35)
Moretti's exploration of this question is through the use of village stories, specifically using Mary Mitford's *Our Village.*
	    Figure 14, page 37, shows that "narrative space is not linear here, it is circular." the figure shows a center, the village, with two rings around it. 
	          what are the implications of circular narrative space?
	    Moretti attributes this circular structure to the way in which the village is viewed:
	        "the older, 'centered' viewpoint of an unenclosed village" (39)
	        the narrator goes on walks, always starting in her village. she walks out of the village and to her destination, and then returns to the village. she does this often, leaving the village and walking a new direction. these destinations create a circle around the village.
